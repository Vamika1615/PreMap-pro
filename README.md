# PrepMap Pro 🗺️📚  
**Turn scattered prep PDFs into a personalised study calendar — 100 % offline.**

---

⚡ **Value Proposition**  
A feather‑light web tool that lets you rough‑out routes, pin POIs, and hand off a single-file “pre‑map” to teammates — no heavyweight GIS software required.

❗ **Pain We Eliminate**
- 💾 **Overkill Tooling**: Students and engineers must install 2 GB GIS suites just to sketch basic maps.
- 📤 **Sharing Friction**: Shapefiles and project folders break over email; recipients often don’t have compatible tools.
- 🕒 **Iteration Lag**: Every minor tweak requires re-exporting, zipping, and re‑sharing bloated GIS projects.
